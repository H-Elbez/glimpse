<p>Glimpse 2.4.0 adds Digital Nautical Chart (DNC) rendering capability to Glimpse.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://github.com/metsci/glimpse/tree/master/extras-dnc">extras-dnc</a> module provides capabilities for pre-processing DNC databases into an optimized format which Glimpse can use to dynamically load, reproject, and render the data interactively and in real time. Glimpse also provides the capability to interactively query DNC map features for their associated metadata.</p>
