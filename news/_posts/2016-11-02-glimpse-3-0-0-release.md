title: Glimpse 3.0.0 Release
---
<p>Glimpse 3.0.0 updates Glimpse to OpenGL 3.0, removing all usage of deprecated OpenGL 2.0 fixed function pipeline features. This allows Glimpse to use OpenGL Core profiles for version 3 and above.</p>

<p>These changes allow all parts of Glimpse to render correctly on platforms which do not support Compatibility profiles (such as MacOS).</p>

<p>Note that this update represents significant changes made to most parts of the Glimpse API, in addition to changing some portions of the public API.</p>
