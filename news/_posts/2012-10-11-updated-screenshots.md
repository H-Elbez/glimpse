title: Screenshots Updated

The Glimpse <a href="/glimpse/screenshots.html">screenshots</a> have been updated to match the available <a href="https://github.com/metsci/glimpse/tree/master/core-examples/src/main/java/com/metsci/glimpse/examples">code examples</a>. Each screenshot now links to the example code which generated it. All examples are also runnable directly from the Glimpse site via <a href="/glimpse/webstart.html">webstart</a>.

The easiest way to get started with Glimpse is to find a few screenshots which are similar to the types of visualizations you need to create and use their corresponding example code as a starting point.
