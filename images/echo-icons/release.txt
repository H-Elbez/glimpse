These icons are free for you to use for both personal and commercial works. I would appreciate credit wherever possible, and would love to see any creation or design that uses my creation.

Some of these icons are currently being used as a part of the current Echo Enduring website and blog design.

YOU MAY NOT:

- sell or otherwise profit from the distribution of these icons

- distribute these icons without proper credit and acknowledgement to the author (me).

- use these icons for any use that would (or potentially could) be deemed pornographic, racist, hateful, criminal or otherwise damaging.

Thanks for understanding! And if you do use these icons, I encourage you to drop me a line! I always love seeing my freebies in action!
